IAM - Identity and Access Management

Three types: users, groups, and roles.
	Users - usually a physical person
	Groups - functions (admins, devops), teams (engineering, design) [contains users!]
	Roles - internal usage within AWS resources
Root account should never be shared or used.
Users must be created with proper permissions.
Policies written in JSON.

MFA can be setup for strengthened security.
IAM has predefined "managed policies".
Best to give users the minimal amount of permissions they need to perform their job (least privilege principle)

IAM Federation 
	- big enterprises usually integrate their own repository of users with IAM
		- allows login using one's company credentials
	- Identity Federation uses the SAML standard (Active Directory)

One IAM user per physical person.
One IAM Role per application
Never share IAM credentials.
Never write IAM credentials in code or commit them. Ever.
Never use root account except for inital setup.

Hands On
	Delete root access keys
	activate MFA on your root account
	create individual IAM users (spits out csv)
	use groups to assign permissions
	apply an IAM password policy (customize password requirements and expiration rates)
